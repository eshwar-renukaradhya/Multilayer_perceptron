# Multilayer_perceptron
In this project we are making use of a multilayer perceptron model to detect the handwritten digits of the MNIST dataset. MNIST database is used to train and test the model. It contains 10000 testing images and 60000 training images.   The MNIST database is in the CSV format. This database consists of 28 x 28 images (N = 784 elements per image).
